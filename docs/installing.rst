The easiest way to install pydecipher as a user is through ``pip``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/mitre/pydecipher.git#egg=pydecipher

Alternatively, if you are including it as a dependency in a packaged Python module, you can include that link in a ``requirements.txt`` file or in a ``setup.py``.

If you plan on installing for development, testing, or building docs, follow the development guide.
